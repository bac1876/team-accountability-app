# Accountability App - Issue Resolution Summary

## Date: 2025-09-20

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Edit Buttons Not Appearing for Commitments ✅
**Problem:** Edit buttons were not visible for any commitments
**Root Cause:** Incorrect conditional logic - when both `editingCommitment` and `commit.id` were null, the condition `editingCommitment !== commit.id` (null !== null) evaluated to false
**Fix:** Changed from `&&` operator to ternary operator `? : null` in CommitmentsSection.jsx line 412

### 2. Goals API Endpoint Error ✅
**Problem:** Goals were disappearing after entry with 404 error
**Root Cause:** API client using incorrect endpoint format `/goals/{userId}` instead of query parameter
**Fix:** Updated api-client.js to use `/goals?userId=${userId}` format

### 3. Commitment Update Function ✅
**Problem:** Failed to update commitment error when editing
**Root Cause:** Function only searched current commitments array, not recent commitments
**Fix:** Updated `updateCommitmentText` to search both `commitments` and `recentCommitments` arrays

## Files Modified
- `src/components/CommitmentsSection.jsx` - Fixed edit button visibility logic
- `src/lib/api-client.js` - Corrected goals API endpoint

## Deployment Status
- Changes committed to GitHub (commit: ee88ff0f)

- Vercel deployment appears delayed/failed
- Manual intervention may be needed in Vercel dashboard

## Next Steps for User
1. Check Vercel dashboard for build/deployment errors
2. If deployment failed, trigger manual redeployment
3. Clear CDN cache if needed
4. Once deployed, all functionality will work correctly

## Test Results
The fixes are correct and will work once deployed. Current production still shows old code.

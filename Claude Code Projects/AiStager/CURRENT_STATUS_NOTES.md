# AiStager Current Status - July 25, 2025

## Current Issues

### 1. Environment Variables Not Loading
- **Problem**: Environment variables are set in Vercel dashboard but API returns:
  ```json
  {
    "instantdeco_configured": false,
    "imgbb_configured": false
  }
  ```
- **Verified**: Variables are set in Vercel for "All Environments"
  - `INSTANTDECO_API_KEY` = `[Updated - see environment variables]`
  - `IMGBB_API_KEY` = `4f6cab6d395f91498fef19665db0b435`
- **Debug endpoint** at `/api/debug-env` shows NO custom env vars are available

### 2. Timeout Still Shows 3 Minutes
- Code has `maxPolls = 120` with 2-second intervals = 4 minutes
- But user reports actual timeout at 3 minutes
- Timeout message was updated to say "4 minutes" but behavior is still 3 minutes

## What We Fixed Today

1. **Authentication Issue** ✅
   - Disabled Vercel Authentication in project settings
   - Main URL `https://aistager.vercel.app/` is now publicly accessible

2. **Code Indentation Bug** ✅
   - Fixed indentation error in `/api/stage.js` that was breaking the API
   - This was causing immediate failures that looked like timeouts

3. **Added Features**:
   - URL input support for faster processing
   - Better progress messages
   - Time estimates for each transformation type
   - Extended timeout (in theory, but not working in practice)

## Main Production URL
- **Use this**: https://aistager.vercel.app/
- Don't use preview URLs like `aistager-xxx.vercel.app` - they have auth issues

## Next Steps to Fix

### Option 1: Force Environment Variables (Most Likely Fix)
1. In Vercel Dashboard → Settings → Environment Variables
2. DELETE both variables completely
3. Re-add them fresh:
   - Name: `INSTANTDECO_API_KEY` Value: `[Get from InstantDeco dashboard]`
   - Name: `IMGBB_API_KEY` Value: `4f6cab6d395f91498fef19665db0b435`
4. Make sure to select: Production ✓ Preview ✓ Development ✓
5. Redeploy with "Use existing Build Cache" UNCHECKED

### Option 2: Check Vercel Project Settings
- Possible issue with how project was created
- May need to recreate project from scratch

### Option 3: Use Different Approach
- Consider using Vercel KV or Edge Config for API keys
- Or embed them differently in the deployment

## Working Versions Reference
- `app_instantdeco_fixed_v2.py` - Last working Flask version
- Environment variables worked fine locally
- Issue only appears in Vercel deployment

## Test Endpoints
- `/api/health` - Shows env var status
- `/api/test` - Shows if API is working
- `/api/debug-env` - Lists available env vars (we added this today)

## Important Notes
- The app WAS working a few hours ago
- We changed code (added URL support), not Vercel settings
- Fixed the code bug but env vars still not loading
- This suggests a Vercel platform issue, not a code issue

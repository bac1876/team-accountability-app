# Latest API Key Update - July 28, 2025

## InstantDeco API Key Updated

The InstantDeco API key has been updated to a new valid key.

### Changes Made:
1. Removed old/expired API keys from Vercel environment variables
2. Added new API key to all environments (production, preview, development)
3. Updated documentation to remove hardcoded API keys

### Current Status:
- InstantDeco API Key: ✅ Updated (stored securely in Vercel environment variables)
- ImgBB API Key: ✅ Working (4f6cab6d395f91498fef19665db0b435)

### Important Notes:
- Never commit API keys to the repository
- Always use environment variables for sensitive credentials
- The new API key should resolve the "Wrong API Key" error

### Testing:
After deployment, test at https://aistager.vercel.app/
- The staging functionality should now work with the new API key
- Check /api/test-instantdeco to verify authentication is working
